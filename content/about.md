Hey there! I’m Prajwal, a Software Engineer with a strong interest in building reliable backend systems and working with cloud and security technologies. I did my Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication from KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, and over time I’ve found myself drawn to solving problems around how applications scale, stay secure, and perform under real-world conditions.


Most of my work and learning revolves around backend development, cloud infrastructure, and security things like designing APIs, securing applications, and exploring ways to make systems production-ready. I enjoy the mix of engineering and problem-solving that comes with it.

Outside of work, I hit the gym during the week, go hiking on weekends, and I’m also a bit mad about bikes. I like keeping a balance between building, learning, and just enjoying life along the way.
